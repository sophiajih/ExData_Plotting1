<b><u>Read Me for Run Analysis Function, Used to Analyze Samsung Wearable Computing Data</b></u>

The Samsung data was generated by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto at Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory

<b>The repo contains the following files:</b>

README.md

Codebook.txt: Describes the data to indicate all the calculated variables and summaries, and any other relevant information

run_analysis.R: R function which, when run, will get and clean the Samsung data and return a tidy data set. Exact steps include:

    1. Merging the test and train data sets 
    2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    3. Adding descriptive activity names
    4. Labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
    5. Creating a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

<b>Additional Notes</b>

The "reshape2" package will need to be installed in order for the run_analysis function to work. Please install using:

    install.packages("reshape2")

To run run_analysis.R, please open the function in R, select "Run", and then use the following:

    run_analysis("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip")

To access the tidy data output from the run_analysis, please input the following into R:

    data <- read.table("./data/tidy_data.txt", header = TRUE)
